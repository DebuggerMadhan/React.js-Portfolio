                        I'm Madhan Aadithya, I'm a Front-end Developer and a Pythonista I'm studying 9th Grade and I started programming at 11 years old,
                        I started my journey with Python and made more practice on it and atlast I started using a web framework called Flask, I learnt html to make static websites with Flask but just Html was not so good so
                        I learnt Css for styling the Html but I was'nt satisfied with my work, I just created Static websites but now in the recent past I've learnt javascript and learnt to create Dynamic websites.
                        I've also learnt Bootstrap for making some lightweight projects.
